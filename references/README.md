This is a list of publications that the Halo work has relied upon, but were not
officially published by the Halo Project. Official Halo publications can be
found in the [publications folder](../publications).

[Virtual People: Actionable Reach Modeling](https://research.google/pubs/pub48387/)
provides a description of the mathematics that underly the Virtual People
Framework.

[A Method for Measuring Online Audiences](https://research.google/pubs/pub41089/)
and
[Measuring Cross-Device Online Audiences](https://research.google/pubs/pub45353/),
which preceded "Actionable Reach Modeling" provide some useful background
for understanding that paper.

RSMB provided a review of the Virtual People Framework as part of an
[Origin Methodology Review](./RSMB-Methodology-Reveiw-and-Concept-Assessment-Project-Origin.pdf)
and [Stage 1](./Origin-VID-Model-Proof-of-Concept-Stage-1.pdf) and
[Stage 2](./Origin-VID-Model-Proof-of-Concept-Stage-2.pdf) proofs of concept.

[Multipart Reach and Frequency Histogram: Private, Secure, and Practical](https://petsymposium.org/popets/2022/popets-2022-0019.pdf)
provides a detailed description of the MPC protocol used by the Halo CMMS.

[Data enrichment for incremental reach estimation](https://research.google/pubs/pub42246/)
describes how to combine multiple panels for measurement.

[Why Differential Privacy is Awesome](https://desfontain.es/privacy/differential-privacy-awesomeness.html)
is the first is a
[series of posts](https://desfontain.es/privacy/friendly-intro-to-differential-privacy.html)
that provide a non-technical introduction to differential privacy.

[Re-identification of "Anonymized Data"](https://georgetownlawtechreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Lubarsky-1-GEO.-L.-TECH.-REV.-202.pdf)
describes some of the issue surrounding re-idenfication.

A mathematical treatment of differential privacy can be found in
[The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf).
